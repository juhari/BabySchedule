BabySchedule for Android
=====

Idea
=====
Parents of newborn babies have a lot of sleep dept and keeping track of when the baby has 
slept, eaten, woken up etc. may be difficult, so usually parents write these down somewhere. 
Babyschedule monitor allows an easy UI to mark down these events.

Features
====
Mark down very easily any events occurring for the baby
Remove mistakenly added events
Edit events
Add events at a later time
Statistics: how often has the baby eaten in a given timebox, how much has he/she slept etc.
Support for multiple babies

TODO
====
Some web sync to be determined later. Maybe google calendar?
Tracking baby’s weight and height etc.
Web sync services between devices with lightweight web backend. (Django, RoR?)
Refactoring particularly for database. It has performance problems, because the schema
is just plain stupid.

Status:
====
Pretty much all the basic functionality. Application has been in test use actively for three months now and some 
small tweaks have been made based on feedback.
